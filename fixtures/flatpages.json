For almost 15 years\r\n\tnow, GTALUG has provided a common forum to exchange\r\n\tinformation pertaining to Linux, and in some cases other open\r\n\tsource software and operating platforms. Members meet\r\n\tregularly at our F2F (in person) meeting locations,\r\n\tparticipate in our email discussion list, and use the\r\n\tresource facilities of this website. Through participation in\r\n\tthe GTALUG forums, and the use of the GTALUG resources, we\r\n\tcombine our efforts to both teach and learn information,\r\n\tallowing us to better control the open source world we are\r\n\tusing, building, and in some cases promoting to others.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost meetings are followed by an informal get together. These\r\n\tusually take place at a restaurant, and provide a free form\r\n\tforum, where you will have a chance to talk with other\r\n\tmembers on a 1on1 or small group basis. These get togethers\r\n\tare where the real benefit of participating in the group\r\n\tbecomes obvious. The chance to directly exchange ideas with\r\n\tother users, to discuss and solve problems, or even get\r\n\tinvolved in open source philosophy or history discussions.\r\n\tThe resources provided by the access to numbers of other\r\n\tLinux users are the most valuable part of participation in a\r\n\tuser group. The long term members of the group, many of which\r\n\thave 30 or more years experience using Linux and other\r\n\tUnix-like operating systems (BSD, Solaris etc.), can provide\r\n\tinsight and ideas that only a seasoned professional would\r\n\thave.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>GTALUG</strong> welcomes anyone who has an interest\r\n\tin Linux. GTALUG will be a benefit to any Linux enthusiast\r\n\tfrom the totally new, to seasoned programmers and system\r\n\tdevelopers, or anyone in between. Have a look at the site and\r\n\tfind something that tweaks your curiosity. Then come on out\r\n\tto a meeting and see what we can do for each other.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a good day, and happy open-sourcing.</p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "By-Law", "url": "/about/by-law/", "template_name": "about/by-law.html", "sites": [1], "content": "<p style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n\tResolution of<br>\r\n\tthe Board of Directors of<br>\r\n\tGTA LINUX USER GROUP ORGANIZATION\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHEREAS:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:upper-alpha\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tGTA Toronto Linux User Group Organization (\"GTALUG\") is\r\n\t\tincorporated under the Ontario Corporations Act for the\r\n\t\tpurposes of:\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tPromoting interest in, and the use of, Linux and\r\n\t\t\t\trelated technologies and solutions;\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tFostering Linux centric educational activities;\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tOrganizing and sponsoring special events for\r\n\t\t\t\tLinux users;\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tIncreasing public awareness of Linux and related\r\n\t\t\t\ttechnologies;\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tProviding various fora for the exchange of\r\n\t\t\t\tinformation and ideas relating to Linux and\r\n\t\t\t\trelated technologies;\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tInitiating and developing Linux technology\r\n\t\t\t\tsolutions to social and technological problems\r\n\t\t\t\twithin The Municipality of Toronto and the\r\n\t\t\t\timmediately surrounding areas.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn furtherance to the provisions contained in By-Law #1 in\r\n\tregard to Members, it is agreed as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"membership\"></a>\r\n<p style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Membership</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Corporation may establish membership classes consisting\r\n\tof:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a name=\"membership_full\"></a>\r\n\t\t<strong>Full Member</strong>, any person who has\r\n\t\tregistered with GTALUG and who possesses a GTALUG \r\n\t\tmembership card.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a name=\"membership_student\"></a>\r\n\t\t<strong>Student Member</strong>, a person who has the\r\n\t\tsame rights and privileges as a\r\n\t\t<a href=\"#membership_full\">Full Member</a> with reduced\r\n\t\tdues.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a name=\"membership_corporate\"></a>\r\n\t\t<strong>Corporate Sponsorship Member</strong>, any\r\n\t\tbusiness or corporation supplying assistance to TLUG will\r\n\t\tautomatically receive a Corporate Sponsorship Membership\r\n\t\tCard.
